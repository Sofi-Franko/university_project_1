# university_project_1
This is the repo for storing my project which is the first task from the discipline WEB-technologies in my university. Just clone and have fun ;)

    Standart testing HTML functionality
The task is to create an `html` page with some `tags` (sections & content) inside. There also should be some `links`, while clicking on them it is going to be redirect to another page that will display another content. Additionly, on the pages you can find `tables` with sections like `header` and `footer`.
